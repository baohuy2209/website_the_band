        Note the grey background. The image does not cover the whole region, but
        it's fully <em>contained</em>.

        Note the ducks/geese at the bottom of the image. Most of the water is
        cut, as well as a part of the sky. You don't see the complete image
        anymore, but neither do you see any background color, the image
        <em>covers</em> all of the <code>&lt;div&gt</code>.
